There are essentially three types of teams:
* Those who make things happen
* Those who whatch what happens
* Those who wonder what the hell happened

Doubles isn't about big forehands and aces and crowd-stunning winners.
Is is a subtle game of grace, ball placement and movement whose masters often
make others feel foolish or simply tempt them to beat themselves.
